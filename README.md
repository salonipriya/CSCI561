<b>HomeWork 1:</b> Implementation of Uninformed Search Algorithm (DFS-BFS-UCS)
            <p>Main Java File: waterFlow.java</p>
            Aim: Determine the shortest path for water to flow from start location to end location. 
                 There can be node in middle where water would not flow at specific time and this constraint should                   be properly handled via the implementation.
